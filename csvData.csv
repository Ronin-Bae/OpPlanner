SPEECH AND DEBATE (minor),"9,10,11,12",CLASS,ENGLISH,"Open to all upper schoolers, grades 9-12, this year-long minor course gives students an exciting and challenging opportunity to strengthen their public speaking skills.  Students prepare and deliver speeches that inform, entertain, and persuade, and they study the rules and techniques of formal debate, learning how to plan and present affirmative and negative arguments."
ENGLISH IX—SEARCH FOR SELF: LITERATURE ACROSS CULTURES AND AROUND THE GLOBE,9,CLASS,ENGLISH,"Students entering the ninth grade are just beginning to step back and question themselves and their surroundings, exploring in various ways their autonomy.  This course is designed to help them discover and nurture their powers of self-reflection in thought, feeling, and expression.  English IX will examine an essential question:  Who am I?  It will explore the power of words and of storytelling to help us give shape and meaning to our experience and to our sense of self and community.  Reading and discussing texts that span the globe, students will come to understand themselves, others, and the interconnectedness of all cultures.As the humanities component of the PDS ninth grade experience, English IX will work to accomplish distinct literature goals and introduce essential skills.  The course will be divided into three parts.To help ninth graders transition to upper school at PDS and to establish a sense of belongingness and inclusivity, we will begin the year with personal narrative writing.  Using our required summer reading as a point of comparison, students will define and question their own backgrounds and values.  They will reflect on how they have emerged into their present states.  This part of the course will provide opportunity to share personal and culturally diverse narratives.Working with a selection of foundational literary texts, first semester will introduce and hone critical reading skills and seminar style discussion.  Students will read for theme, character, symbol, tone, voice, and style.  They will write formal, analytical essays and personal responses to the stories they read.  They will also craft short stories and poems.  During the second semester, students will write a short research paper that will help them become familiar with the resources available through the PDS libraries, strengthen their research skills, and learn to use information technology efficiently and wisely.  The goal is not simply to improve writing skills, but to strengthen the students’ sense of self-confidence about their individual powers of self-expression.During the second semester, English IX reads stories from different cultural perspectives. Purple Hibiscus, a collection of Chinese short stories, and Othello, among others, will showcase characters in conflict with their familial, religious, and/or cultural roots.  These stories of journey and self-discovery align with the global case studies students will be examining in their World Religions in History course across Shepherd Commons.  There will be ample opportunity for shared discussion and assessments as well as a final project that will allow students to articulate their understanding of how stories help determine self and how they teach, preserve, and build cultural identity."
"ENGLISH X — AMERICAN LITERATURE:  JOURNEY, CONFLICT, AND THE AMERICAN DREAM",10,CLASS,ENGLISH,"Tenth grade is a year when students come into their intellectual and analytical power.  English X nurtures this developmental phase by focusing on close reading and analysis of text.  The course is designed to help students grow as readers and thinkers who can interpret beyond the literal and respond to a text in more nuanced and complex ways, both critically and creatively.  Whereas English IX looked outward to examine literature from around the globe, English X will turn inward to examine American literature.Ours is a rich literature of trials and tribulations, successes and failures, hopes and dreams.  It is a literature of journey and self-discovery, a literature of grappling with and articulating the American dream, a literature of assimilation and self-reliance, of subjugation and betrayal.  English X will trace the competing narrative threads that define American literature and the American sense of self.  Essential questions of the course include:  What does it mean to be an American?  What are the distinguishing features of American culture and of the American story?Students will engage in close reading of The Namesake, excerpts from the essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, The Great Gatsby, Another Brooklyn, When the Emperor was Divine, The Thousand Crimes of Ming Tsu, and select plays, poems, and short stories.  They will be encouraged to ask open-ended questions in writing and discussion and to connect one piece of literature to another, to the U. S. history they are studying, and to their own experiences.  Students will write both critical and creative responses to the texts they read.  They will also assemble a poetry portfolio and draft several short pieces of fiction.  The course will culminate in a research project that will allow students to draw explicitly on materials, information, and knowledge they have gathered in both English X and U.S. History.Grades Eleven and Twelve - ElectivesUpperclassmen choose from a rich selection of semester-long electives.  During the fall semester, juniors and seniors will enroll in one of fourteen electives designed to strengthen their skills as readers, writers, and critical thinkers.  In late January, juniors will begin a second semester English course with a focus on writing; seniors will participate in our signature Senior Reading & Writing Intensive seminar."
ASIAN AMERICAN LITERATURE,"11,12",CLASS,ENGLISH,"In his op-ed for The New York Times titled “Asian-Americans Need More Movies, Even Mediocre Ones,” Viet Thanh Nguyen coined the term “narrative plenitude.”  He argues that Asian American stories have not been included in the grand narrative of America.  Nguyen writes that “[he] and most other Asian-Americans grew up and still live in the opposite of ‘narrative plenitude.’  We live in an economy of narrative scarcity in which we feel deprived and must fight to tell our own stories and fight against the stories that distort or erase us.  Many Americans will take these Asian images — which are usually awful — and transfer them to any Asian-American they encounter.”This course is an introduction to Asian American Literature.  In it we will explore the origins of and what it means to be “Asian American” and how Asian American Literature works to disrupt the stereotypical “single story” of the perpetual foreigner (to use Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s term) that is often told about Asians.  We will read from a range of texts, across multiple genres and time periods, including works by Maxine Hong Kingston, Viet Thanh Nguyen, Cathy Park Hong, Jhumpa Lahiri, Jessica Hagedorn, and Kimiko Hahn as well as other Asian American writers of different ethnicities."
COMING OF AGE,"11,12",CLASS,ENGLISH,"In this course we will study the ""bildungsroman:” a German word that can mean “a novel of education” or “novel of formation” – in other words, stories about ""coming of age.” The texts we will engage with will invite us to reflect upon ourselves and upon our relationship with the world. Who do we understand ourselves to be, and who do we want to become? We will explore questions of identity, belonging, sexuality, and growth, as well as how our personal stories interweave into larger historical and cultural flows such as immigration, capitalism, and social inequities. This course will be grounded in interdisciplinarity and we will put literature in conversation with history, psychology, cultural anthropology, and film. In addition to reading certain sections from Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre, texts will include Jean Rhys’ Wide Sargasso Sea, Jhumpa Lahiri’s The Namesake, and Ocean Veung’s On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous. Our goal will be to challenge ourselves and each other to think and grow together."
CREATIVE WRITING,"11,12",CLASS,ENGLISH,"This course is for students with strong writing skills, a particular interest in creative writing, and the desire to explore writing in a range of forms — including personal essays, critical essays, poetry, short stories, plays, and screenplays.  Significant class time will be devoted to a shared exploration of the writer's craft through individual conferencing, critiquing in small groups, free-writing, and presenting works in progress.  For the final project, students will assemble a portfolio containing their best revised creations as well as an artist’s statement concerning how and why their writing and their approach to writing have changed.  To thrive in the atmosphere of freedom and experimentation that this course encourages, students should possess a self-motivated commitment to the craft of writing and a genuine eagerness to explore (and help others explore) the range and depth of their voices as writers.Models will be drawn from such longer works as The Things They Carried (O’Brien), Jesus’ Son (Johnson), A Visit from the Goon Squad (Egan), and Woman Hollering Creek (Cisneros) as well as a number of selected short stories, poems, and essays.  Reading will also include reflections on the life of a writer from the journals and essays of various writers."
GIVE MY REGARDS TO BROADWAY:  AMERICAN PLAYS AND MUSICALS,"11,12",CLASS,ENGLISH,"“The word theater comes from the Greeks. It means ‘the seeing place.’    It is the place people come to see the truth about life… The theater is a spiritual and social x-ray of its time.”-- Stella Adler, Actress and Acting TeacherThis elective provides an introduction into the exploration of plays and musicals from the 20th century through today.  We will read and discuss plays as literature intended for theatrical performance, often dealing with the translation of the written page onto the stage and screen.  The plays will be examined from the perspectives of history, cultural context, and form.  Topics will include the relationship between theater and society, narrative structure, theatrical representation, and the crafts of theater artists such as directors, designers, playwrights, and actors.  We will engage with video archives of past performances and hopefully attend a live performance.A musical tells a story with words and music.  Beyond those basic elements, any limitations around what a musical can or cannot be is up for debate.  In addition to looking at the past, present, and future of American musical theater, we will engage in a broad exploration of musical storytelling across many aesthetic sensibilities and time periods.  In this course we will get to know the history of the film musical and discuss the social, aesthetic, and philosophical issues created and represented by it.  During the course we will view and discuss classical Hollywood films alongside other films which attempt to push the boundaries of the form.Written texts may include works by Neil Simon, August Wilson, Tennessee Williams, Suzan Lori-Parks, Steven Dietz, and L. Frank Baum.  Film screenings may include Singin’ in The Rain, Death of a Salesman, A Streetcar Named Desire, The Wizard of Oz, Carmen Jones, Lost in Yonkers, Flower Drum Song, and Moulin Rouge."
"THE GREAT MIGRATION: UNDERSTANDING THE PAST, IMAGINING THE FUTURE","11,12",CLASS,ENGLISH,"In her exhaustively researched book on The Great Migration, The Warmth of Other Suns, Isabel Wilkerson states, “They did what human beings looking for freedom, throughout history, have often done.  They left.”  In this course we will explore the impact that The Great Migration has had on Black American and diasporic communities through an examination of art, music, and literature spanning from the early years of the Migration through a contemporary study of Afrofuturism.  We will examine the impact that migrating and resettling has on the characters:  some characters very literally migrating as a part of the historical Great Migration and others in search of freedom and agency in a dystopian world.  Whether the text is rooted in history or science fiction, the course’s essential questions will remain:  How is someone's sense of place, self, and belonging challenged as a result of their migration or journey?  How does the reimagination of black power create hope for change and agency?  How are authors intertwining past, present, and future as they reimagine Black and Black American narratives?  Texts may include Jacob Lawrence’s Migration Series; the poetry of Hughes, McKay, and Cullen; Nella Larsen’s Quicksand; Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God, Nnedi Okorafor’s Binti Trilogy; and Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther.(HI)STORY IN FILM AND LITERATUREEvery picture tells a story and every story is made up of words spun together to form vivid images on the page.  “(Hi)Story in Film and Literature” will explore the ways in which both film and literature work to preserve, critique, and even reinterpret the past.  Working with the assumption that history books, historical documents, artifacts, and public records are not the only way to learn about the past, this course will look to film and literature as valid forms of a collective “cultural memory.”  Whether we are examining the French Revolution, WWII, the Native American experience, or Vietnam, we will seek to understand significant moments in history through stories that have been crafted in words or in moving pictures.  We will explore how artistic works of various eras celebrate, criticize, or reconstruct the past.  Alongside our study of what story is being told, we will question the different perspectives from which all (hi)stories can be told (victor, victim, male, female, the upper class, the masses, the young, and the old).  Works read may include Benioff’s City of Thieves, Zusak’s The Book Thief, Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad, Tim O’Brien’s The Things They Carried, and Safran Foer’s Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close.  Films may include Au revoir les enfants, Nuit et brouillard, Bonnie and Clyde, Little Big Man, Django Unchained, and American Sniper.Students will do historical research on each period studied, present “History blips” to the class, and keep a journal of the discoveries they make while reading and viewing works from different moments in history.  They will craft several close analysis essays, a film review, a creative story retelling an important historical event from an “untraditional” perspective, and a Vietnam Veteran memoir."
JOURNEY IN LITERATURE,"11,12",CLASS,ENGLISH,"Could you be happier on your journey this fall at PDS?  Even while negotiating the messiness of your “add-oh-less-sense” present and preparing simultaneously for the future of college and adulthood?  What if you made more lists?  Studied the pitfalls of perfectionism and procrastination?  Tried to keep childhood alive?  Quieted the mind and tried meditating?  Charted your work-out schedule?  Perhaps mentors and/or famous fictional writers will offer you answers which resonate:  “It’s silly to think you are anything more than a passenger on this planet; we find that after years of struggle we do not take a trip; a trip takes us.”  (Steinbeck); “Don’t give into your fears.  If you do, you won’t be able to talk to your heart.”  (Coelho).  Or perhaps not: “So it goes.”  (Vonnegut) To look for journey truths which could revitalize your approach to life, you will visit kindergarten and the eighth grade, interview friends, listen to a panel of Journey-class alums (now in college), discuss life choices with parents and grandparents, and perhaps even visit a home for the elderly. Cornerstone fictional and real-life texts focusing on the seven journey stages will shepherd you through chronological, racial, identity-based, socio-economic, and geographical boundaries: At the Bottom of the River (Jamaica Kincaid), House on Mango Street (Sandra Cisneros), Slaughterhouse Five (Vonnegut), Into the Wild (Jon Krakauer), Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest (Cheryl Strahed), and Crying in H Mart (Michelle Zauner).  Psychological studies, poetry, plays, short stories, chapters from various memoirs, and films (The Red Balloon, Rebel Without a Cause, and The Graduate) will offer you supplemental worlds to visit and contemplate.  Opportunities to reveal your “growth mindset” will include presentations to peers, creative and analytical writing, and the course-long challenge of Journey:  writing and then speaking the results of how you improved your happiness over four months (this project is based on your summer read of Gretchen Rubin’s The Happiness Project.)"
THE LIVES OF OTHERS:  INVESTIGATING THE GRAPHIC NOVEL,"11,12",CLASS,ENGLISH,"One look at hieroglyphics will provide a potent reminder that visual storytelling is a fundamental aspect of the human experience.  Since the 1980s the graphic novel, or long-form comic, has become a popular and accomplished literary and artistic form.  The contemporary graphic novel is a collaboration between text and image, which blends the shape and arc of the novel with the conventions of visual storytelling.  Rigorously studying graphic novels means engaging in new scholarly inquiries that challenge students about how image and text work together to convey meanings that would not be conveyed separately.  This course offers a survey of some of the most evocative graphic novels of the last forty years while concurrently providing the skills for reading comics critically in terms of what they say and how they say it.Throughout the semester we will examine the evolution, subject matter, form, and future of the graphic novel genre.  The focus of this course will be on how artists create stories and characters and how to interpret and contextualize such works.  This is an interdisciplinary course that will investigate a multitude of media and topics such as racial constructions, stereotypes, assimilation, performativity, immigration, and identification.  Ultimately, this is a course about humanity and how image and text can be utilized to shift one’s understanding of another person’s reality.Please Note: The foundation of this course is an investigation of mainstream graphic novels; however, we will also be reading relevant novels, plays, poetry, and short stories which match with the major themes and/or events of graphic novels that are included in the syllabus.  Works by graphic novelists such as Art Spiegelman, Marjane Satrapi, Alison Bechdel, Alan Moore, Miriam Katin, and Daniel Clowes  may be included in this course."
"MAGIC, MONSTERS, & MACHINES – A STUDY IN BELONGING  & HUMANITY","11,12",CLASS,ENGLISH,"This course will explore representations of monstrosity and magic in literature.  Monsters often reveal our deepest fears while magic presents our most prevalent desires — what we wish for most.  In this course we will explore the societal, cultural, and historical implications of the monsters we meet and the magic that reveals the character's most dire needs and attempts to survive.  We will work with the course's essential questions: how do authors use monsters or magic to reveal societal fears and desires?  What does it mean to be human?  How do humans (and perhaps even monsters) find a sense of self and belonging amidst the turmoil?  Texts may include TJ Klune’s The Lives of Puppets, Moshin Hamid's Exit West, Kazuo Ishiguro’s Klara and the Sun, and Karen Russell's Swamplandia!"
THE PEN AND THE SWORD:  POWER AND POLITICS IN LITERATURE,"11,12",CLASS,ENGLISH,"Lord John Acton once famously said, “power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”  Throughout this course we will examine the truth of that claim.  What is it that makes humans wish to control others?  How do people determine the difference between privileges and inalienable rights, and what do they do when the latter are taken away?  What makes people stand up and fight?  What happens after the dust has settled, and the new regime is in place?  What is to be done when the cure is no better than the disease?This course will require us to grapple with divisions along ideological, class, race, and gender lines.  While the texts we will study in this class are all fiction, each has its root in real-world problems, either current, historical, or potential.  Possible texts include George Orwell’s classic allegory, Animal Farm; Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar; Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart; Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale; and Frank Capra’s Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. We will consider what the authors’ original intent might have been and how successful those goals ultimately are.  In other words: Is the pen really mightier than the sword?  Writing will be largely analytical, but there will also be opportunities for students to wield their own pens as (metaphorical) weapons."
POETRY: MAKING MEANING,"11,12",CLASS,ENGLISH,"If, as Marianne Moore wrote, “you demand on one hand.../ the raw material of poetry in/all its rawness and/ that which is on the other hand/ genuine, then you are interested in poetry.”  Bring your interest in poetry and a desire to develop your skills as a poet to this class.  We will consider and study a wide range of traditional and contemporary poetry as well as voices in translation, looking at collections of poetry in addition to individual poems. There will also be a significant poetry writing component; experimenting with a variety of forms — including the sonnet, villanelle, pantoum, and ghazal — each student will gradually create a portfolio of poems to share in class.  In addition to the portfolio, students will keep a journal of observations and notes for poems to be written.  Students will also write analytical essays on selected poems.  Along the way students will immerse themselves in one poet’s work and share their research with the class.  Texts include The Making of a Poem: A Norton Anthology of Poetic Forms, Mary Oliver’s A Poetry Handbook, and selected poems."
RED HERRINGS AND (LITTLE) GREY CELLS: THE DETECTIVE IN LITERATURE,"11,12",CLASS,ENGLISH,"There is something immensely satisfying about curling up with a good mystery novel, whiling away the time reading about secrets, lies, murder, and mayhem from the safety of our own living rooms.  But why?  What is it about the genre that has made it so enduringly appealing?  Throughout this course we will strive to articulate an answer to that question while we examine the evolution of the fictional detective, from the epitome of the “formal” detective, Sherlock Holmes, to the ultimate “hard-boiled” detective, Sam Spade.  We will consider the ways in which these detectives reflect the time and place of their creation and what their moral codes tell us about our own society.  We will also hone our own detective skills as we analyze dialogue for means, motive, and opportunity; dissect plots to distinguish between red herrings and genuine clues’ and, of course, try to figure out “whodunnit.”  Possible texts include A Study in Scarlet by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd by Agatha Christie, John Huston’s film adaptation of The Maltese Falcon, In a Lonely Place by Dorothy B. Hughes, and Rian Johnson’s twists on the genre:  Brick and Knives Out.  In addition to writing analytical essays and informal responses to the literature, students will have the opportunity to create their own murder mystery games and write original short stories."
SHAKESPEAREAN INSPIRATIONS,"11,12",CLASS,ENGLISH,"Shakespeare’s plays encompass the range of human experience in ways as intriguing and provocative today as when they were written.  For this reason, they continue to inspire new generations of writers, filmmakers, and musicians who recast Shakespeare’s work in innovative and surprising interpretations.At the heart of this course lies the open-endedness of Shakespeare’s characters and plays.  Shakespeare’s creative imagination seems limitless, and yet, he continually calls on us and on our imaginations, inviting us to co-create alongside him.  Shakespeare does not editorialize, moralize, or tip his hand.  He shows us everything, but he tells us nothing.  We must fill in the blanks for ourselves and form our own stories, stories that continue to unfold and evolve long after the plays have ended.  When we approach Shakespeare through the questions, large and small, that his plays inspire in us, we engage in a conversation with the author and with ourselves.  Moreover, we dissolve the artificial distinctions among auditor, reader, actor, director, scholar, and creative artist.We will approach Shakespeare’s plays through reading aloud, informal class performances, class discussions, and small group presentations.  Assessments will include creative, reflective, and analytic writing that is grounded in authentic, rather than purely literary, questions about the plays and characters.  In addition, students will have the chance to share their research on some aspects of Shakespeare’s plays, such as the source material, historical and fictional, that inspired them.  Readings will include Macbeth, Othello, and either A Midsummer Night’s Dream or Much Ado About Nothing."
GRADE WORLD RELIGIONS IN HISTORY,9,CLASS,HISTORY,"This course will investigate how religion and philosophy provide meaning to the human experience.  During the first half of the course, we will create a foundational and sympathetic understanding of the major families of religion and philosophy by exploring their origins, core beliefs, key practices, and diverse expression in today’s world.  These families include, in chronological order: Indic religions (Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sikhism), East Asian religions (Confucianism and Daoism), and Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam).  During the second half of the year, we will examine how these worldviews evolve and maintain their traditions as they come into contact throughout world history.  We will take a case study approach to explore themes of intellectual evolution, cultural assimilation, and syncretism, as well as conflict and conquest.  Examples of case studies could include the interaction of Hinduism and Islam in Mughal India; the intersection among Christianity, Islam, and African traditional religions in Nigeria; genocide and the Holocaust; and the tension between traditional Chinese thought and Maoist philosophy in modern China.  At the end of the year, students will write a research paper on some aspect of religion in America."
GRADE AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE,10,CLASS,HISTORY,"The goal of the 10th grade American History course is to inspire students to become reflective, concerned, and engaged citizens who are armed with a deep and broad understanding of our collective past.  Blending together the very best of chronological and thematic approaches, the curriculum highlights the manifold innovations, dreams, flaws, failures, and achievements of a diverse population.  Essential themes underscore the nature of identity and culture; geography, people, and the environment; citizenship, governance, and power; work, exchange, and technology; and global interconnectedness.  Through primary and secondary source analysis, writing assignments, and projects, students will hone their analytical thinking and research skills throughout the year.  Students will engage in two interdisciplinary American Studies research papers that combine students’ work in both the English and History Departments."
AP ART HISTORY,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"This course examines art produced across the world from the earliest civilizations to the present (roughly 3000 BCE to 2015 CE), providing students with a global foundation in the history of art and architecture and focusing on a core of 250 works.  We will deal with major artistic monuments and movements, paying particular attention to how art shapes and is shaped by the social, historical, religious, and political circumstances of the period and culture.  Following the redesign of the AP Art History exam, which students are required to take, are the three big ideas of this course.  First, artists manipulate materials and ideas to create an aesthetic object, act, or event.  Second, art making is shaped by tradition and change, and third, interpretations of art are variable.  Our three essential questions for the year will be:  What is art and how is it made?  Why and how does art change?  How do we describe our thinking about art?  Our emphasis on culture, history, writing, and critical analysis fosters the kinds of skills crucial for success in any profession involving synthetic thinking.  To extend their learning, students will have opportunities to explore local and regional art museums."
AP COMPARATIVE GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"AP Comparative Government and Politics is an introductory college-level course that uses a comparative approach to examine the political structures; policies; and political, economic, and social challenges of six selected countries: China, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia, and the United Kingdom.  We begin by focusing on foundational political concepts and ideas before moving on to an examination of the history, structure, and policies of the six course countries.  Employing the disciplinary practices of political scientists, students analyze data and text-based sources as they explore topics like power and authority, legitimacy and stability, democratization, internal and external forces, and methods of political analysis.  This course is designed to prepare students for the Advanced Placement Comparative Government and Politics Exam by making demands upon them equivalent to that of an introductory college course."
AP EUROPEAN HISTORY,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"Advanced Placement Modern European History is a full-year course focusing on European history from 1450 to the present, including the Renaissance and Reformation, the evolution of Constitutionalism, the Enlightenment and French Revolution, the rise of Nationalism, the World Wars and the Cold War, and Modern Europe.  Coursework includes analysis of historical documents, student-centered activities and simulations, and rigorous development of the writing craft through document-based, long essay and short answer questions.  This course is designed to prepare students for the Advanced Placement Modern European History Exam by making demands upon them equivalent to that of an introductory college course.  This includes using an AP-level textbook and supplemental primary and secondary materials.  Highly motivated, independent learners who have a strong interest in European history should take this course.  Students are required to take the AP exam in May."
AP HUMAN GEOGRAPHY,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"This course examines the ‘why of where,’ as students learn to employ spatial concepts and geographic analysis to understand the economic, social, political, cultural, and demographic organization of human societies and their environmental impact.  Content is presented thematically rather than regionally and is organized around the discipline’s main subfields: economic geography, cultural geography, political geography, urban geography, and population geography, as well as food production and agriculture.  The approach is spatial and problem oriented.  Case studies are drawn from all world regions with an emphasis on understanding the world in which we live today.  Major topics include:  economic development, cultural change, population growth, migration, ethnicity, gender and race, political conflicts, food production and agricultural land use, urban development, and climate change.  By the end of the course, students should be more geoliterate, more engaged in contemporary global issues, and more nuanced in their viewpoints.  Geographic understanding should become a source of ideas for identifying, clarifying, and solving problems at various scales and a key component of building global citizenship and environmental stewardship.  Students are required to take the AP exam in May.AP U.S. GOVERNMENT AND POLITICSThis course focuses on power in the United States.  Politics helps determine the distribution of power in a society.  Together we will practice research, writing, critical thinking, and political engagement skills.  We will prepare for the exam in AP U.S. Government and Politics by examining the American system of government from many angles.  Students gain a familiarity with the various institutions, groups, and ideologies that shape U.S. politics with a focus on how varied interpretations of the United States Constitution affects our lives.  Students will engage in textbook reading, supplemental material, and the analysis of Supreme Court cases.  As the material in this class affects society deeply on a regular basis, students should expect to keep up with the news.  Ultimately, this course will help students become more aware and involved members of American democracy.  Students are required to take the AP examination in May."
AMERICAN FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"This course is an introduction to American foreign policy from the Cold War to the present.  The United States is and will likely remain the most important actor on the international stage for some time, so this course considers how America came to occupy that position and what it means for the future.  To answer these questions, the class is divided into three sections.  First, we will consider the history of the Cold War, especially the saga of the Vietnam War, to the fall of the Soviet Union. Next, we will analyze the institutions and ideas which have shaped the debate between isolation and intervention in places such as Somalia, the former Yugoslavia, Kuwait, Afghanistan, and Iraq.  Finally, we will turn to a range of contemporary challenges facing the United States, including terrorism, nuclear proliferation, human rights abuses, cyberwarfare, global governance, and more.  By the end of the course, students will better understand the world around them and the emergence of future conflicts as well."
BIOETHICS,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"Should humans use animals for food or other resources?  Should a person be able to end their life when they have a terminal illness?  Is it right to terminate a pregnancy?  Always?  Sometimes?  Never?  Most importantly, why?If thinking about, discussing, researching, and grappling with questions like these excites you, Bioethics is the course for you!  Bioethics is a broad field of study that pulls from different disciplines to explore and respond to moral and ethical dilemmas.  For any dilemma we study, we’ll explore it scientifically and ethically.  Scientific conclusions can inform moral decisions.  For example, when grappling with whether to use new vaccine technology (as we did with the COVID vaccines), scientists can gather empirical observations about safety and efficacy to inform decision making.  We will learn not only to understand relevant scientific content, but to analyze those conclusions for power and limitations to help us decide how they inform a moral dilemma. To determine what we might consider a right action, we will learn to employ ethical frameworks – such as utilitarianism – to assist us in our decision making.  Likewise, we will read ethical positions constructed by philosophers (who sometimes disagree with each other!) to see how they think about the dilemmas we discuss.In this course students will be asked to do the following:Start any exploration by asking questions to direct their learning;Consume a variety of sources to learn pertinent scientific content;Evaluate scientific conclusions (pulled from primary literature) for power and limitations;Read philosophical positions to understand them (rather than critique them);Apply ethical frameworks to inform one’s decision making;Fairmindedly articulate positions with which one may disagree;Listen to and learn from classmates; andConstruct positions on dilemmas for which there is no one right answer."
BOLLYWOOD:  MODERN INDIAN HISTORY THROUGH FILM,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"This one-semester course will examine the making of modern India by looking at important events between 1857 and the present.  As a window into this important history, we will study how popular Indian films have interpreted (and sometimes misinterpreted) key moments and developments in this period.  Beginning with the Great Uprising of 1857 through the struggle for independence, Partition, and the social and political upheavals of the post-colonial era, we will come to understand how the Indian subcontinent was shaped into its current form over the past 175 years.  We will view a variety of films throughout the semester, such as The Rising: Mangel Pandey, Lagaan, Rang de Basanti, Tamas, Salaam Bombay, and Three Idiots.  Readings from primary and secondary sources will help students assess and analyze the issue of historical and social perspective in these films.  Students will write a series of short essays, participate in class discussions, and engage in a concluding project."
"BREAKING NEWS, FAKING NEWS, & MAKING NEWS","11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"This course prepares students to be ethically informed and engaged members of the global community by exploring current world events and issues as case studies.  Through source analysis, simulations, discussions, and research, students will evaluate multiple perspectives on contemporary issues and examine the systems that frame global networks and connections.  Past case study topics have included the treatment of Uigur Muslims in China, climate change policy, the militarization of police, and the 2020 U.S. presidential election.  In addition to understanding and analyzing current issues facing different regions of the world, students will develop global thinking dispositions and media literacy skills.  The course culminates in an inquiry-driven Global Advocacy Project in which students use the design-thinking process to identify and investigate an important global issue of their choosing and to create a plan of action to address that issue.  Past Global Advocacy Projects have included a website addressing COVID vaccine inequities in America, a campaign against mass incarceration, and a curriculum about redlining and its modern implications."
"CLASS, RACE, AND POVERTY","11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"This course examines various intersections of race and class in American society. The central focus will be developing an understanding of how race and class work together to shape life as we know it.  Along the way we will highlight particular topics such as home ownership, environmentalism, criminal justice, and education.  In each case a deep dive will familiarize us with specifics as we unpack the emergence of social, political, and economic inequalities as well as the mechanics of resistance.  By the end of the term, students will better understand the complexities of life in America and how to live with empathy for the experiences of others."
CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN FEMINISM,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"The goal of this course is to examine what it means, and has meant, to be a feminist in the United States and to help students identify their own space within this paradigm.  Together we will unpack the theory and history that inform where American society is today and look at cultural reflections, positive and negative, that shape the experiences of those who identify as women in this country.  Organized around three lenses – Mind, Body, and Heart & Soul – this course invites students to engage deeply in the study of feminist voices and their intellectual roots and offers many opportunities to express where students’ personal narratives become part of the story of American feminism."
DISRUPTION: TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"Imagining a life without smartphones, internet shopping, or social media is difficult, but these everyday technologies have only been around for a decade or two.  Considering how dramatically the human experience has changed in the past twenty years, technology has clearly disrupted our society, transforming how we learn, interact, work, and live in fundamental ways. This disruptive nature of technology is nothing new, however.  Historical discoveries such as the printing press, the steam engine, and plastic have completely revolutionized how human beings operate.  Through this course, students will examine past, present, and emerging technologies to better understand the disruptive impact of innovation, gaining critical perspective on the role technology has played in history, and the big questions that face humanity today.  Students will hone their research, writing, and media literacy skills while pursuing topics of personal relevance, and the class will have opportunities to interact with professionals in fields revolutionized by technology. Additionally, students will gain a basic understanding of how cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and digital fabrication actually work."
ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY:  NATURE AND POWER,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"This class radically expands our notion of history.  It argues that history must include both people and plants, animals, and disease.  From agriculture to bitcoin, little can exist without considering the environment.  Environmental historians also push on categories that people use to divide the world.  What makes something “natural” or “artificial,” “wild” or “civilized,” “human” or “non-human”?  In this class students will deepen their understandings of the world.  They will study documents, images, and the environment itself.  Topics cover a range of human difference and experience, including indigenous societies, environmental racism, energy and technology, health and medicine, food politics, and ideas of gender and the body."
ETHICS,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"This course is an introduction to the philosophical study of morality.  Ethical questions confront us every day:  Should I buy a latte or give a few dollars to charity?  Is it ever okay to lie?  Should I support abortion rights?  What about gun control?  Why should I care about the suffering of animals?  Most of us have thought about these questions, but ethicists explore them in all their beautiful complexity.  Over the course of the semester, we will survey key ethical platforms such as utilitarianism, deontology, rights, virtue, and care while applying these insights to contemporary social controversies."
FREEDOM IS A CONSTANT STRUGGLE: AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY IN THE 20TH CENTURY,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"Organized chronologically with an emphasis on 20th century people and events, this course highlights the history of African Americans and the struggle for equality and human dignity.  We will interrogate the definition and codification of race in the United States, analyze the institutionalization of segregation through policy and practice, and examine the myriad ways in which African Americans have protested, resisted and generated change.  Through primary and secondary source readings, documentaries, and discussions, we will explore African Americans’ contributions to the nation’s identity and prosperity and what they reveal about the role and significance of diversity in American society.  Prominent themes include urbanization, the development of the modern civil rights movement and its aftermath, the thought and leadership of black intellectuals and activists, and the continuing push for equity and inclusion."

GLOBAL MIGRATIONS IN HISTORY,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"The history of people is the history of their movement.  This course considers global case studies of both forced and voluntary migration to explore how people have built different societies.  In following the movement of people between places, the course tracks different visions of who belongs, how societies should run, and relationships with the natural environment.  It examines the causes of migration from war and famine to economic growth and cultural magnets.  It also explores the experiences of migrants themselves; the rules that people put up to include, exclude, and jail migrants; the effects of migration on the places to which people come and go; and the grave policy implications of stories and metaphors.  Ultimately, students will become better versed in world history by studying the people who connect societies across the globe and the ideas, cultures, and material objects they brought with them."
GRANDEUR OF AFRICA,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"In this semester-long course, we will examine what we know as well as why we know what we know about Africa as both a real geographic and political space and a historically constructed idea.  The goal of such study is to subvert the notion that “Africa” or “Africans” can be spoken of in general and historically unspecific terms.  To this end we will examine the long arc of African history from prehistory to the modern era.  We will explore the migrations of early African peoples, the evolution of African languages, and the development of regional material culture.  African spirituality, intellectual life, and civilization building will challenge long-held Western myths about the world’s second largest continent.  Key moments in African commercial and economic development will provide the student with an appreciation of the dazzling diversity and complexity of pre-colonial African states that confirms the continent’s rightful place in world history.  We will conclude by tapping into student interests to examine ways that a meaningful understanding of the African past helps us to make sense of the continent today."
HOLOCAUST & GENOCIDE STUDIES,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"This course will introduce students to the many atrocities that have taken place throughout history and resulted in the ethnic cleansing and systemic genocide of millions over time.  Relying on a case study approach, students will examine the Holocaust, and genocides in Armenia, Darfur, Rwanda, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia, Ukraine, and those targeting Native Americans, Yazidi, and Herero people.  Drawing upon survivor and witness testimonies when possible, students will explore the conditions and circumstances that lead to genocide and examine how groups and individuals resist in an effort to maintain their faith, culture, and identities.  Students will advance their understanding of genocide and ethnic cleansing in the hopes of creating a deeper empathetic and compassionate world."
LATIN AMERICAN HISTORY,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"This course is an introduction to the rich tapestry that is modern Latin America.

Through thematic units and case studies, students will explore topics such as Latin America’s economic development and integration into the global economy; the legacies and experiences of indigenous peoples; the construction of race and identity; the role of religion and folklore; environmental degradation and protection; the relationship between politics, militaries, and human rights; expressions of music, art, and literature; and patterns of urbanization and migration.  The foundational text of the course, Faces of Latin America by Duncan Green and Sue Branford, will be supplemented with primary source materials and critical scholarship representing a diversity of perspectives and experiences. Students will cultivate critical news literacy by following current events from across the region, build reasoning and writing skills by seeking to reconcile the many narratives that constitute Latin America, and consider their own identities as global citizens by examining the relationship between the United States and its southern neighbors."
LAW AND SOCIETY,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"While we all strive to create a just society, we often disagree over process and results.  This class will explore the theoretical foundations of justice and how America has implemented various philosophical theories over time.  The class will first introduce students to the major theories of justice in the Western tradition and then dive into the history and application of constitutional law.  Students will read Michael Sandel’s Justice, significant speeches and treatises from American history, as well as Supreme Court cases.

MEDIA AND ADVERTISING,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"From snake oil salespeople at carnivals to Tik Tok influencers, the drive to buy and sell has defined American life.  This course examines how that historical impulse has helped lead to contemporary issues, such as battles over fake news and misinformation.  Advertising has long blurred the lines between art, entertainment, news, health advice, and sales pitches.  Students will learn to analyze those lines with sophistication and context.  They will critically read advertisements as text, images, music, and video.  They will also explore different types of media, from old magazines to Instagram posts.  Tracking controversies in advertising and media, students will develop their understanding of advertising history by considering persistent questions of ethics, appropriation, authenticity, and representation."
MICROECONOMICS,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"Microeconomics is an introductory college-level course that gives students an understanding of how society allocates its resources, how individuals and producers make decisions, and how the government can become involved in those choices.  Students cultivate their understanding of individual economic decision-makers by using principles and models to describe economic situations and predict and explain outcomes with graphs, charts, and data as they explore concepts like scarcity and markets; costs, benefits, and marginal analysis; production choices and behavior; and market inefficiency and public policy.  Course materials include Gregory Mankiw’s Principles of Economics, articles from current sources such as The Economist, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and a variety of graduate business school case materials.  Although basic mathematics is used to study many of the course’s topics, there are no math prerequisites to enroll in the class; the course is intended to be equally appropriate for students with primary interests in either humanities or math/science."
PHILOSOPHY,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"This course is an introduction to the great questions of philosophy:  Are we living in a simulation?  Do we have free will?  Can machines think?  What is the good life?  Philosophers relentlessly pursue such topics, and this course will explore their efforts across key fields: epistemology (what can we know and how can we know it), metaphysics (what exists and what is its nature), and philosophy of mind (what makes you you and why does it matter).  In considering such questions, philosophy makes the invisible visible and forces us to carefully examine our lives and the world around us."
POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"Positive psychology is the scientific study of human strengths and virtues.  It uses psychological theory, scientific research and evidence-based interventions to understand and improve human well-being.  This course examines a variety of psychological concepts that fall under the broad umbrella of positive psychology: positive emotions, personal strengths and virtues, gratitude, mindfulness, growth mindset, and grit.

QUEER IN AMERICA,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"The iconic 1969 Stonewall Uprising in NYC inaugurated an era of large-scale activism and gradual but increasing visibility of LGBTQ people.  However, we must remember that LGBTQ history predates Stonewall by centuries.  For example, in the pre-colonial era, many Native American societies honored gender and sexual fluidity.  The queer stories of white folks and people of color have also long been woven into the fabric of American life.  In this semester-long course, we will discover how these intimate narratives of same-sex love and pioneering gender creativity offer us an inspiring and poignant view from the margins of our nation’s history.  We will also explore how queer narratives have been informed by and intersected with gender, race, and class in complex – and sometimes surprising – ways."
SCIENCE & SOCIETY,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"How can science change over time?  What we call scientific knowledge comes to us through the work of people, and people cannot escape the politics of their societies.  In this class we will look at scientific discovery dating back to ancient cultures while also exploring what it means to call knowledge “scientific” rather than traditional, religious, folk, pseudoscientific, or some other name.  This course will walk students through major developments in medicine, public health, and our understanding of the universe.  In doing so we will explore how people have used scientific authority to erect hierarchies of class, race, and gender — and how ideas about class, race, and gender have compromised scientific work.  The class will also consider the efforts of varied groups to suppress scientific knowledge and the ethical issues that come to the fore in any scientific work.  Students interested in science, philosophy, and history will find information and questions that deepen their understanding of how knowledge and power interact."
WHO RUNS THE WORLD? WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP,"11,12",CLASS,HISTORY,"History courses tend to focus predominantly on the contributions of male leaders, often overlooking, diminishing, or erasing women’s stories and experiences from the historical narrative.  This semester-long course will shift the focus and challenge students' understanding of women in leadership roles throughout history.  From Hatshepsut’s reign over ancient Egypt to Empress Wu Zetian’s rule during the Tang Dynasty, to the prime ministerships of Indira Gandhi in India and of Golda Meir in Israel, students will examine the history of some of the most powerful and influential women throughout global history.
